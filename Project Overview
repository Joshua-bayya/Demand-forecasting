Project: Price Elasticity & Promotion Impact Analysis
Dataset: Breakfast at the FratTools: Python (Pandas, Statsmodels), Power BI


Objective: Estimate product-level price elasticity and assess promotional impact (display, feature, TPR) on weekly sales across categories and store tiers.


Key Steps

1. Cleaned and preprocessed 524K rows of transaction data
2. Addressed missing prices using logic around base price, spend, and TPR
3. Calculated price discount metrics and outlier flags using units_per_visit and visits_per_hhs
4. Built log-log OLS regression models per UPC with sufficient variation and observations (n > 20)
5. Merged elasticity scores with product metadata
6. Created a Power BI dashboard with filters, promo breakdowns, and elasticity distribution

Key Findings

1. Frozen pizza and snack categories show high price elasticity; oral hygiene products are largely inelastic
2. Circular features are the most effective promo type, especially in cereal(+80%) and oral care, while display promotions drove results in frozen pizza and snack categories.
3. Around 1 in 3 products were highly elastic (Îµ < -2)

Measures

1. Protect elastic products with discounting, increase prices on inelastic products to capture margin.
